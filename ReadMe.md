## Introduction
This course aims to provide hands-on experience with full stack development. The lessons are designed to assess your current skill level and guide you through a series of projects that will help you master each technology.

## Course Structure

### Skill Assessment
The first lesson involves designing a simple system to test your skills. Based on your performance, you'll be guided to the appropriate level:
- **HTML/CSS Test**: If you pass, you'll proceed to the JavaScript test.
- **JavaScript Test**: If you pass, you'll proceed to the React test.
- **React Test**: If you pass, you'll proceed to the Node.js test.

### Project-Based Learning
Each project is designed to build on the skills assessed in the previous test. The progression is as follows:
- **Project A**: HTML and CSS
- **Project B**: JavaScript
- **Project C**: React
- **Project D**: Node.js

## GitHub Repository Structure

### Student Folders
All student submissions are organized in the `students/` folder. Each student has a unique folder named with a special key, such as `#ST-001`. Inside each student's folder, you'll find their project source code.

### Project Folders
Inside each student folder, there are subfolders for each project:
- `Project-A`: HTML and CSS
- `Project-B`: JavaScript
- `Project-C`: React
- `Project-D`: Node.js

### Assignments Folder
Outside the `students/` folder, there is an `assignments/` folder. This folder contains different tasks for each project, which are distributed to students.

## Online Classes
To further assist students, online classes are available. These classes provide one-on-one guidance with a professional and are conducted via Google Meet or Skype. Each class costs $50.
